As a part of the portfolio projects, we created this project primarily based on Tableau Dashboard. We got the data from SQL quesries. Later exported the data into Excel files. Then used that data in Tableau to create the dashboard. Besides showing the COVID situation globally, we predicted the infection rate for next 6 months in the dashboard.
